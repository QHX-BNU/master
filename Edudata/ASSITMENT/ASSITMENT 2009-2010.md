# Tip1
- Questions are based on one specific skill, a question can have multiple skill taggings. 
    
- Students must answer three questions correct in a row to complete the assignment;
    
- If a student uses the tutoring ("Hint" or "Break this Problem Into Steps"), the question will be marked incorrect;
    
- Students will know immediately if they answered the question correctly;
    
- If a student is unable to figure out the problem on his or her own, the last hint will give the student the answer;
    
- Currently, this feature is only available for math problem sets.
